# Hi! I'm Phil!

Most of the people in my life look at me and think, "This guy could totally do my taxes!"  What they don't know is that since 2023 I've been moonlighting as a hacker... or trying to at least.  I've spent the last 13 years of my life in the accounting world and through shifts in the accounting market and some serious soul searching I've come to the point where I'm ready to tackle the next adventure, something that brings more meaning to my life than making sure two numbers at the bottom of my spreadsheet match.

When I was introduced to cyber security in July 2023, I thought I was very out of my depth.  With several years of hobbyist coding and macro scripting under my belt, seeing the shear amount of stuff I still didn't know felt daunting.  It didn't suit me knowing there were still things outside my known cyber world to explore, so I geared up and set out.  I dual booted Kali Linux on my laptop, I got myself plugged into some bounty hunting groups / platforms, and I set out to find some bugs!

As of January 2025, I've clocked over a thousand hours on my journey.  I can now explain a lot more than I used to when it comes to the internet.  However, I'm not near the end of my journey.  In fact, I hope this adventure never ends.  That's why I've started this blog.  I want to get serious about participating in cyber security, moving away from accounting and taking up the challenge of discovering exploitable attack surface and helping to secure it from all the dangers in our world.  

## My Mission

I am currently developing this blog as a way to test my knowledge and grow within the cyber security world. My hope is to land a security job, preferably one that situates me between those catching bugs and the engineers that plug up the holes!

## My Vision

I would ultimately like to be a Bug Bounty Hunter myself, at least in a parttime capacity while I work actively on a security team.  In order to achieve this, I have a long way to go.  The short term mission should hopefully get me oriented in the right direction.  I am excited about the people I will meet on this journey and the ways I'll play my part in securing our world!
