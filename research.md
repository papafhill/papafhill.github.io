# Overview

This catalogue of research is to document my journey towards mastery of these vulnerabilities, and to share that information with you.  Mastery of a vulnerability involves a lot of research and real world practice.  I'm going to try to break this down as methodically as I can.

I will cover the following in each post:

+ What is the vulnerability?
+ Deep Dive
+ CWEs, OWASP Posturing, and  
+ Testing Checklists
+ Prominent Tools
+ Advanced Tips & Tricks
+ Fuzzing
